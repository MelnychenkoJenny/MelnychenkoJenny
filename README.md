### Hi there üëã

I'm an avid front-end developer. I have experience working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build dynamic and responsive web applications. I am proficient in using React and React Native to create engaging user interfaces that deliver seamless experiences across multiple platforms. 

Additionally, I have experience with Node.js and am familiar with Trello for project management. I am well-versed in Agile methodology (Scrum) and thrive in a collaborative team environment. My attention to detail allows me to deliver pixel-perfect designs that meet the highest standards of quality and aesthetics. 

I dream of becoming a professional and very soon it will be so. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
